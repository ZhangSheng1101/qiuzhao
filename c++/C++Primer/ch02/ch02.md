If we assign an out-of-range value to an object of **unsigned** type, the result is
the remainder of the value modulo the number of values the target type can
hold. For example, an 8-bit unsigned char can hold values from 0 through
255, inclusive. If we assign a value outside this range, the compiler assigns the
remainder of that value modulo 256. Therefore, assigning –1 to an 8-bit
unsigned char gives that object the value 255.



If we assign an out-of-range value to an object of **signed** type, the result is
**undefined**. The program might appear to work, it might crash, or it might
produce garbage values.



The compiler appends a null character (’\0’) to every string literal. Thus, the
actual size of a string literal is one more than its apparent size. For example, the
literal 'A' represents the single character A, whereas the string literal "A" represents
an array of two characters, the letter A and the null character.
